    <h2>Why This Shelter Matters</h2>
    <p>In Rochester, too many dogs and cats are suffering from abuse, neglect, and abandonment. They're not just strays — many of them have been thrown out, forgotten, or hurt by the people who were supposed to love them. These animals need help, and they deserve safety, healing, and love. That’s why I, Enora, am working to open a shelter: a place where these animals can recover, be cared for, and find forever homes.</p>
    <p>This shelter won’t just be a place to keep animals — it will be a community effort to protect and care for lives that are too often overlooked. I believe that every animal matters, and with your help, we can prove it.</p>

  <section id="donate" class="section">
    <h2>Donate to Make It Happen</h2>
    <p>Your donation helps make this shelter real. Every dollar goes toward food, medical care, shelter space, and rescue operations for animals in need. We’re building something from the ground up, and every bit of support brings us closer to opening the doors.</p>
